Rosella helps you to view the data and ask questions about a machine learning model together in the same space.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rosella like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("janithwanni/rosella")
```

At the moment Rosella can show a proof of concept shiny application which will be extensible to your own data and model in the future releases.
